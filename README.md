# Eventful

A flexible event system for Unity.

## Setup

This package depends on [dbrivzov/NaughtyAttributes](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes). Unfortunately, UPM does not currently support git package dependencies. You will need to add NaughtyAttributes to your project's `manifest.json` file manually:

```js
"com.dbrizov.naughtyattributes": "https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes.git#upm"
```
